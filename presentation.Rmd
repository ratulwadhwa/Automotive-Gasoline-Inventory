The objective of this case study is to produce forecasts of the total automotive gasoline inventory
on a month-to-month basis, using a combination of econometrics and arithmetic functions in R.

+ Production and imports are considered as the inputs here and sales and exports are the outputs.

.content-box-soft[ 
.white[**production+imports-sale-export**] 
]

--

+ The equation above gives us the total inventory of the automotive gasoline. 
+ The negative values here indicates shortage, outflow more than inflow.

```{r}

test

```

--

+ The test statistic is tiny, and well within the range we would expect for stationary data. So we can conclude that the data is stationary.

.white[**Unit Root Tests**] 
]


```{r}
ndiffs(invts)
nsdiffs(invts)
```

--

+ To double check that I used nsdiffs() and ndiffs() functions and as they returns 0, it suggest we do not need seasonal difference and a first difference.

---

.content-box-blue[ 
.white[**Differencing The Data**] 
]

+ Although the tests suggest that there is no differecing required as the data is stationary. 
+ There are very high fluctuations in the inventory dataset.
+ It is based on so many other factors.
--

+ Hence, I created another forecast model with keeping econometric point of view in mind and adding a differencing in the Seasonal part of the model.

(p,d,q) Non seasonal part 
(P,D,Q) Seasonal part

+ Based on the ACF and PACF plots the following two models were selected to forecast the Total Automotive Gasoline Inventory on a month on month basis. 

+ ARIMA (0,0,1)(1,0,1)[12] 
+ ARIMA (0,0,1)(0,1,1)[12]

--

Both the ARIMA model does well in capturing all the dynamics in the data as the residuals seem to be white noise.

+ The second model (with differencing) captures the fluctuations a little better than the first forecast ARIMA model. 
+ The p value for the model with differencing is higher (0.8653) than the p value without differencing (0.7278) which also suggests that the second model might be performing slightly better.
